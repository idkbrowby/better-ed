# Introduction
One of the goals of sustainable development is quality education. With our project, we aim to establish quality education in the software development domain. We intend to do that by taking the user step by step through a project. Each project is split into milestones, with each milestone building up on the concept of the previous milestone.

# Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
